# Preparation of Nitrate Measurement #

For the nitrate measurement with the CitizenSensor device a number of preparations are necessary. Specifically, several solutions have to be prepared that are needed for the measurement process:

- Calibration fluids 
- Ion amplifier solution (ISA) 

The calibration liquids are required to obtain precise measurement values during nitrate measurement.

The ion amplifier solution (ISA) is required to produce an aqueous solution from the soil sample. The aqueous solution contains the sodium dissolved from the soil sample.

The CitizenSensor device supports the user in the preparation of all these solutions.

# Basic Knowledge about Calibration and Calibration Solutions #

The CitizenSensor device must be calibrated with calibration solutions of varying concentrations before the nitrate measurement. In concrete terms, three calibration solutions with different nitrate concentrations are presented to the measuring instrument.

In the CitizenSensor device, potassium nitrate calibration solutions are used that have a concentration of 100 ppm, 4 ppm, 0.1 ppm and 0.01 ppm NO3-N.

Hints:
- "100 ppm" means, for example, that the solution contains 100 mg of substance per liter
- "100 ppm NO3-N" means that the solution contains 100 mg nitrogen per litre

During calibration, the measuring instrument determines the associated electrical potential (the voltage in millivolts) for each of the calibration solutions and stores this value. For example, the following measured values could result from the calibration:

- 4 ppm: 290 mV
- 100 ppm: 230 mV

Once the CitizenSensor meter is calibrated, the nitrate concentration in aqueously dissolved soil samples can also be measured precisely.
Based on the calibration readings, the CitizenSensor meter can calculate the nitrate concentration of the soil sample by interpolation.

Hint:
The measuring range of the CitizenSensor meter is limited.
A meaningful measurement can only be made in the range 0.1 ppm to 100 ppm NO3-N,
because only in this area there is a linear relationship between nitrate concentration and electrical potential.

# Basic Knowledge of the Ion Amplifier Solution #

The nitrate measurement in the CitizenSensor device is carried out with an ion sensitive electrode. The electrode used is designed for nitrate measurement in liquids. Therefore, an aqueous solution of the soil sample must first be prepared for the measurement. When preparing the aqueous solution, the sodium is dissolved out of the soil sample. 

For the measurement with the CitizenSensor device, the soil sample is not simply dissolved in distilled water. 

Instead, the electrode used requires an "ion strength adjustment solution" (ISA) for optimum measurement results. Specifically, the ISA solution is an ammonium sulfate solution (see [5] page 3).

# Using the Ion Amplifier Solution and Calibration Solutions #

Once the calibration solutions and the ion amplifier solution have been prepared, a nitrate measurement can be performed with their help.

The entire procedure consists of 
- Preparation of an aqueous solution from a soil sample
- Calibration of the CitizenSensor device
- Carrying out the nitrate measurement

The individual steps are:

1. Fill cup with soil
2. Fill cup with distilled water
3. Shake aqueous solution of soil and water
4. Filter aqueous solution
5. Calibrate the CitizenSensor device using the **calibration fluids**.
6. Add **Ion strength adjustment solution (ISA)** to the aqueous solution
7. Stir aqueous solution with ISA
8. Carry out nitrate measurement of the aqueous solution while continuing to stir

## Producing calibration liquids ##

### Tools and Materials for the Production of Calibration Fluids ###

The following tools and materials are required for the production of calibration liquids:

- Potassium nitrate (4 g)
- Plastic cup (200 ml capacity)
- Knife (dosage with knife tip)
- Distilled water: spray bottle with 500 ml

### Production of the Calibration Solutions ###

The production of calibration solutions is triggered on the CitizenSensor device by selecting the menu item "Kalibrierl√∂sung herstellen". The instrument then guides the user through the steps required to prepare the solutions.

The calibration solutions are prepared in two steps. First a stock solution with a concentration of 5000 ppm is prepared. This stock solution is then further diluted to produce solutions with 100 ppm, 4 ppm, 0.1 ppm and 0.01 ppm.

This procedure was chosen because the precision of the integrated scale in the CitizenSensor device is limited. Only a highly concentrated solution of 5000 ppm can be weighed with an acceptable error.

The individual steps in the preparation of the stock solution are: 
- Calibrate the balance
- Weigh in potassium nitrate (3609.3 mg)
- Fill the cup with distilled water (100 ml)
- Stir stock solution
- Label the cup (5000 ppm)

In this way, diluted calibration solutions are produced one after the other.
- **100 ppm calibration solution** is formed from 5000 ppm stock solution (2.08 ml) with 102.03 ml water 
- **4 ppm calibration solution** results from 100 ppm calibration solution (4.11 ml) with 98.64 ml water 
- **0.1 ppm calibration solution** results from 4 ppm calibration solution (2.75 ml) with 107.25 ml water 
- **0.01 ppm calibration solution** results from 0.1 ppm calibration solution (10 ml) with 90 ml water
