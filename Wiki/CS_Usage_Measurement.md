# Nitrate Measurement #

## Basic Knowledge for Nitrate Measurement ##

The CitizenSensor device should enable every user to perform a nitrate measurement. To achieve this goal, the software of the CitizenSensor device guides the user through the individual steps of the nitrate measurement process.

Since the basic knowledge of nitrate measurement is contained in the software of the CitizenSensor, no further specialist knowledge is required to carry out the measurement process. The step-by-step instructions ensure that the necessary procedures are followed during the measuring process.

The CitizenSensor instructional software guides the user through four phases of the measurement:

1. Preparation of the measuring electrode
2. Calibration
3. Nitrate measurement
4. Storing the measuring electrode

Please note that the nitrate measuring electrode must be stored in a dry place to avoid damage. For this reason, the measuring electrode must be "released from stock" in step 1 before the measuring process and moistened for some time before the measurement. For the same reason, the measuring electrode must be dried and "transferred to stock" after the measurement in step 4.

In step 2 the CitizenSensor device must be calibrated before measurement. This ensures that the device delivers accurate readings when measuring nitrate.

The actual nitrate measurement takes place in step 3. 

Finally, the nitrate measuring electrode is rinsed in step 4 and stored dry.

Sufficient time should be planned for the entire measurement process - the entire process takes about 2 hours. If several measurements are carried out in succession, it is not necessary to calibrate the CitizenSensor device before each individual measurement.

## Tools and Materials for Nitrate Measurement ##

The following equipment and materials are required for nitrate measurement:

- CitizenSensor device
- Measuring electrode
- Calibration solutions
- Filtered, aqueous solution of the soil sample
- ISA Solution

## Procedure for Nitrate Measurement ##

### Preparation of the Measuring Electrode ###

The nitrate measuring electrode must be stored in a dry place to avoid damage. Immediately before measuring nitrate, however, the measuring electrode must be stored in liquid for some time to prepare it for measurement.

The steps for preparing the nitrate measuring electrode are

1. Releasing the dry measuring electrode from stock
2. Rinsing the measuring electrode with distilled water
3. Storing the measuring electrode in 4ppm calibration solution for two hours

### Calibration ###

The CitizenSensor device must be calibrated with three differently concentrated calibration liquids (0.1 ppm, 4 ppm and 100 ppm KNO3) before the nitrate measurement.

[Details on preparing the calibration solution](https://github.com/CitizenSensor/CitizenSensor/blob/master/Wiki/CS_Usage_Preparation)

The calibration process ensures that the CitizenSensor device delivers the most accurate readings possible.

To start the calibration, the menu item "Kalibrieren" must be selected on the CitizenSensor device. The device then guides the user through all further calibration steps.

The individual steps of the calibration are: 
- Select calibration solution
- Rinse the electrode
- Start stirring the calibration liquid
- Measurement of the calibration liquid

## Nitrate Measurement ###

The nitrate measurement is performed with the filtered, aqueous solution of the soil sample. For the measurement, a so-called ion amplifier solution (ISA) must be added to the aqueous solution.

To start the nitrate measurement, the menu item "Messen" must be selected on the CitizenSensor device. The device then guides the user through all further steps of the nitrate measurement.

The individual steps of the nitrate measurement are 
- Calibration of the scale
- Weigh aqueous solution
- Add ISA solution
- Start stirring the aqueous solution
- Nitrate measurement

The final result of the measurement is given by the CitizenSensor device in unit "Nmin". 

### Transferring the measuring electrode to stock ###

After the nitrate measurement, the measuring electrode must be rinsed with distilled water and shaken dry. The electrode can then be stored in a dry place.

If further nitrate measurements are planned in the near future, the measuring electrode can also be stored in 4ppm calibration solution for a limited period of time. To avoid damage to the measuring electrode, storage in liquid for more than three days should be avoided.

### Interpretation of the measurement results ###

The CitizenSensor project does not deal with the interpretation of nitrate readings, as this would go beyond the scope of the project. For the evaluation of the measurement results we refer to other sources of information, such as [6].
