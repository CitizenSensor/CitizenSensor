# Soil Preparation #

## Basic Knowledge for Preparation of Soil Samples ##

In the previous step "soil sampling" a total of 2 kg soil was collected. This soil sample is composed of several individual samples, which were taken at different locations and at different depths.

For the nitrate measurement, a representative portion of approx. 100 g soil must now be taken from the total quantity of 2 kg soil. A representative portion can only be obtained if the sample is well mixed beforehand.

The first step is therefore to grind the soil sample, which crushes larger chunks of soil. In this step, larger stones should also be removed from the soil sample. By grinding the soil sample, the sample can then be mixed much better.

In the second step, the quantity of the soil sample is systematically reduced. **Here it is important not to take "any subset" of the soil sample.** In practice, it has been shown that **measuring errors of 10 to 25 percent** occur if the soil sample is mixed and reduced with an unsystematic approach.

For the systematic reduction of the soil sample a sample divider should be used.

If no sample divider is available, it is recommended to reduce the sample size using the "cone and quarter" method (see [04], p. 23/24). This method ensures that an even mixture of larger and smaller soil crumbs is taken.

## Tools and Materials for Preparation of Soil Samples ##

- **Plastic bags with soil samples** (results from step "Soil Sampling")
- **Soil grinder**, **mincer** or fine-mesh **sieve** (5 mm)

## Procedure for Grinding Soil Samples ##

The soil sample should be ground using a soil mill until crumbs of 5 mm or less are formed.

If a soil mill is not available, the sample should be ground with a mincer or grated through a fine-mesh sieve (5 mm).

## Procedure for Grinding Soil Samples with a Mincer ##

1. **Fill soil sample into small bucket**

2. **Crush larger pieces of soil** in the soil sample by hand
3. **Sort out larger stones in the soil sample** 
The soil sample should only contain stones that are smaller than the distances of the screw conveyor in the mincer - otherwise the mincer could block while turning.

4. **Unscrew the fastening ring of the mincer and remove the perforated disc**.

5. **Grind the soil sample in portions** with the mincer: 
Fill soil sample into the filling funnel of the mincer and grind by cranking. It is recommended to crank with little force. Blockages can be released by alternately cranking forwards and backwards.

If the ground soil sample still contains too large chunks of soil, it should be ground with the mincer again. If the grinding with the mincer results in compressed "soil sausages" these can be crumbled very easily with the fingers.

## Procedure for Reducing the Sample Quantity with the Sample Divider ##

1. **Fill the ground sample (2 kg) into the opening of the sample divider:** The two collection containers of the sample divider now each contain half the sample quantity (1 kg).

2. **Fill reduced sample quantity into the sample divider again**. The halved quantity can now be taken from one of the collecting containers.

3. **Repeat step 2 three more times:** halved sample quantities of 500 g, 250 g and 125 g are obtained.

4. **Fill reduced sample quantity (125 g) into plastic cups.**

## Procedure for Reducing the Sample Quantity by "cone and quarter" Method ##

1. **Pour the soil sample (2 kg) into a small soil cone.**

2. **Quarter the soil cone with a thin panel.**

3. **Halve the sample quantity:** the diagonally opposite quarters of the soil cone are removed with a garden shovel.

4. **Pour the remaining sample amount into a soil cone again:** the remaining soil is shovelled into a bucket, then poured back into a small soil cone.

5. **Repeat steps 3 and 4 three more times:** this produces halved sample quantities of 500 g, 250 g and finally 125 g.
