# CitizenSensor Usage #

The CitizenSensor device enables the measurement of nitrate in soil. The measuring device works with an electrochemical sensor that can determine the nitrate content in aqueous solutions.

For a nitrate measurement in soil, therefore, several steps must first be taken to produce an aqueous solution from a soil sample.

The accuracy of the nitrate measurement result depends strongly on how carefully the soil sample is taken and prepared.

We therefore recommend following the steps in the following instructions as closely as possible.
