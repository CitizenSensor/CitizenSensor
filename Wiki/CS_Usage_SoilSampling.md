# Soil Sampling #

## Basic Knowlegde on Soil Sampling ##

In practice, it has been shown that the biggest measurement errors in nitrate measurement are caused by an incorrect methodology when taking or preparing soil samples.

It is therefore advisable to follow the procedure described below as closely as possible when taking and preparing soil samples.

The recommended procedure aims to produce a homogenised soil sample. Substances like ammonium, nitrate and nitrite are typically not evenly distributed in the soil. If a single soil sample was taken at only one location for the nitrate measurement, the nitrate measurement would result in a rather random nitrate measurement value.

A homogeneous soil sample is achieved by taking several soil samples at different locations (sampling points) and at different depths. For orientation: in agriculture, 15 to 20 samples are typically taken for nitrate measurements [01] [02] [03].

In total, a sample quantity of 2 kg soil should be obtained when taking the soil sample. The individual samples are then carefully mixed in the "sample preparation" step so that a soil sample is obtained in which ammonium, nitrate and nitrite are evenly distributed.

A quantity of 20 g of soil can then be taken from this soil sample for the nitrate measurement. Since the soil sample has been homogenised beforehand, the measured value for the partial quantity of 20 g is representative for the entire sample.

## Tools and Materials for Taking Soil Samples ##

### Three-part Auger ###

![Auger](https://github.com/CitizenSensor/CitizenSensor/blob/master/Wiki/images/21000_Bohrstock.jpg?raw=true)
_Image 1: Auger_

The auger should be designed for impact depths of 0-30 cm, 30-60 cm and 60-90 cm. Other designations for the auger are "Nmin drill" (Nmin stands for "N mineral") or "[Pürckhauer (German disgnation)](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C3%BCrckhauer)".

### Drop Hammer ###

![Drop Hammer](https://github.com/CitizenSensor/CitizenSensor/blob/master/Wiki/images/21000_Schlaghammer.jpg?raw=true)
_Image 2: Drop Hammer_

The drop hammer is used to drive the auger into the ground.

### Knife / Screwdriver ###

![Screwdriver](https://github.com/CitizenSensor/CitizenSensor/blob/master/Wiki/images/21000_Messer_Schraubendreher.jpg?raw=true)
_Image 3: Knive or Screwdriver_

A knife or a screwdriver is used to scrape the soil sample out of the auger. When sampling with a spade, a strip is cut out of the soil sample while utilizing a knife.

### Spade ###

_Image 4: Spade_

If no auger is available for sampling, the soil sample can alternatively be taken with a spade. If an auger and a spade are available, the auger is the preferred tool.

### Labeled Plastic Bags for Soil Samples ###

![Plastic Bags](https://github.com/CitizenSensor/CitizenSensor/blob/master/Wiki/images/21000_Bodenprobe30-60.jpg?raw=true)
_Image 5: Plastic Bag_

Labelled plastic bags should be kept available for sampling in order to document the origin of the soil samples.

For sampling with an auger, three bags should be labeled per sampling point("0-30", "30-60" and "60-90"). For sampling with a spade, one bag per sampling site is sufficient.

Ideally, the location (e.g. the number of the sampling site) and the date of sampling should also be noted on the bag.

### Cool Box / Cooler Bag ###

![Cool Box](https://github.com/CitizenSensor/CitizenSensor/blob/master/Wiki/images/21000_Kuehlbox.jpg?raw=true)

A cool bag or cool box with some cool packs is used to transport the soil sample. 

## Proceedure for Taking Soil Samples ##

First of all, it must be determined at which different locations soil samples should be taken. For this purpose, 15 to 20 sampling points should be determined, whereby these should be distributed as evenly as possible - but randomly - over the area to be measured (see [03] page 9).

The following steps should be carried out at each sampling point:

### Sampling by Auger ###

1. **Treading down the soil at the extraction point:** treading down the soil is only necessary for loose soil. This step is not required for drawing samples from grassland.

2. **Clean the auger:** the auger should be free of soil residues from previous drillings

3. **Hammering in the auger:** the auger is plunged vertically and then hammered in with a drop hammer. For the first sample the auger should be hammered in up to the 30 cm mark. For the further samples the sampling depth is 60 cm or 90 cm.

4. **Unscrewing the auger:** the auger is unscrewed by pulling upwards.

5. **Remove the top layer of soil:** the top 2-3 cm of the soil sample should be removed from the auger. By removing the top layer, it is avoided that the sample is contaminated by soil from the adjacent soil layer.

6. **Scrape out the drill core:** the drill core is scraped out of the auger into the sample bag with a knife / screwdriver.

For further information on sampling with an auger see [01].

### Sampling by spade ###

1. **Dig a hole in the ground at the sampling point:** the hole should be at least as wide and as deep as the blade of the spade.

2. **Cutting off a soil slice:** a soil slice is cut off at the edge of the earth hole. The soil sample should be between 20 and 30 cm high and 5 cm thick.

3. **Cutting out a bar of soil:** a bar of soil is cut out of the centre of the soil slice. The bar of soil should be approx. 3 cm wide - this results in a bar of soil of 3 cm x 5 cm x 30 cm.

4. **Pack soil bar into the sample bag.**

For further information on sampling by spade see [03].

### Transport and storage of soil samples ###

The soil samples should be cooled down to at least 5 degrees Celsius to inhibit the activity of soil bacteria. If the soil sample is warmed-up to higher temperatures, this will lead to a falsified nitrate measurement value.

If a measurement of the nitrate value cannot be made on the day of the soil sampling, the soil sample should be stored in a freezer until measurement.
