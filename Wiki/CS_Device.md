## Device Functionality ## 

CitizenSensor is a device for electrochemical measurement of nitrate in soil.
The CitizenSensor device can not only carry out nitrate measurements, but also supports the user in all steps necessary to prepare a nitrate measurement.

The CitizenSensor device can also be used to prepare the calibration solutions and ion amplifier solutions required for nitrate measurement.

## Structure of the Device ##

The CitizenSensor device consists of a specially shaped housing and the electronics contained in it for the electrochemical measurement of nitrate.

### Housing Top ###

At the top of the CitizenSensor housing there are several openings in which larger or smaller cups can be placed.

The large front openings are intended for placement of cups (200 ml). 

In the bottom of the left front opening there is a scale which is used for weighing in salts, water or soil.  

In the bottom of the right, front opening, a magnetic stirrer is integrated, which supports the preparation of solutions and enables stirring during nitrate measurement.

### Housing Front ###

For user interaction, the CitizenSensor device has a control button on the front for user input. The control knob can be turned to the right, to the left and it can be pressed.

The large touch display serves on the one hand for graphic displays of operating steps, but can also be used as an input device for clicking on buttons.

### Housing Back ###

At the back of the CitizenSensor device there is a Micro-USB socket and a BNC socket.

The CitizenSensor device is supplied with power via the Micro-USB socket. For this purpose a USB charger with 2A should be used.  

An electrochemical sensor can be connected to the BNC socket.

## Operating the CitizenSensor Device ##

### Startup ###

The unit turns on as soon as it is connected to a power source. At startup, some output is first made on the command line. Then the CitizenSensor welcome screen is displayed, followed by the main menu. It takes about one minute in total until the device has started up and can be operated. Do not disconnect the unit from the power source during start up.

### Function Selection ###

After starting, the menu of the CitizenSensor device is displayed. The menu structure of the CitizenSensor device is
- Calibration
- Nitrate measurement
- etc

The current function can be **selected** by **rotating** the control button.

After starting a function, the device runs through all steps of the selected function. In the case of the "Calibration" function, for example, these are the steps

- Select calibration solution
- Rinse electrode
- Start stirring the calibration liquid
- Measurement of the calibration liquid

The individual steps of the functions are self-explanatory - all necessary information and instructions are shown on the touch display.

After the last step of a function, the device returns to the main menu.

### Switch Off ###

The CitizenSensor device can be switched off by selecting the "Herunterfahren" function.

The switch-off process takes about 15 seconds. After selecting "Herunterfahren", the unit will shut down. Once the screen is black, the CitizenSensor device can be disconnected from the power source.
